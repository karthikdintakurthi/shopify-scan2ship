# India-Specific Requirements for Scan2Ship

## Overview

This document outlines the India-specific requirements and guardrails implemented in the Scan2Ship Shopify app to ensure successful merchant onboarding and checkout experience.

## Getting Started Stepper

The app includes a comprehensive "Getting Started" page (`/app/getting-started`) that guides Indian merchants through the setup process with specific focus on:

### 1. Shopify Plan Requirements

**Carrier-calculated shipping rates** require specific Shopify plans or billing arrangements:

- **Shopify Plus**: Full access to carrier-calculated rates
- **Annual billing**: Upgraded access to carrier-calculated rates  
- **Monthly plans**: Limited access (may require upgrade)

**Implementation:**
- Plan eligibility detection via GraphQL
- Non-blocking warnings for unsupported plans
- Direct links to Shopify Help Center documentation
- Clear upgrade path guidance

**Shopify Help Center Links:**
- [Carrier-calculated shipping guide](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/setting-up-shipping-rates#carrier-calculated-shipping)
- [Third-party shipping calculators](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/setting-up-shipping-rates#third-party-shipping-calculators)

### 2. Carrier Service Registration

**How it works:**
1. Scan2Ship automatically registers via GraphQL `carrierServiceCreate`
2. Shopify calls our `/carrier/rates` endpoint during checkout
3. We return real-time rates from Indian carriers
4. Customers see accurate shipping costs before purchase

**Technical Details:**
- Uses GraphQL Admin API 2025-07 exclusively
- REST API is legacy and not supported for new public apps
- Automatic registration during app installation
- Status monitoring and health checks

### 3. API Architecture (GraphQL Only)

**Why GraphQL?**
- More efficient data fetching
- Better type safety
- Future-proof architecture
- Required for new public apps

**Key GraphQL Operations:**
- `carrierServiceCreate` - Register our service
- `fulfillmentOrders` - Get fulfillment data
- `fulfillmentCreateV2` - Create fulfillments

### 4. Webhooks & Permissions

**Required Webhooks:**
- `ORDERS_CREATE` - Sync new orders to Scan2Ship
- `FULFILLMENTS_UPDATE` - Track fulfillment status
- `APP_UNINSTALLED` - Cleanup on removal

**Required Scopes:**
- `read_orders` - Access order data
- `write_shipping` - Register carrier service
- `write_fulfillments` - Create fulfillments
- `read_locations` - Access store locations

## India-Specific Features

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Plan Detection
```typescript
async function checkPlanEligibility(shop: string): Promise<{
  hasRequiredPlan: boolean;
  planType: string;
}> {
  // GraphQL query to check shop plan
  // Returns plan type and eligibility status
}
```

### 2. Carrier Service Status
```typescript
async function checkCarrierServiceStatus(shop: string): Promise<{
  isActive: boolean;
  status: string;
}> {
  // GraphQL query to check carrier service status
  // Returns active status and health
}
```

### 3. Progress Tracking
```typescript
const allRequirementsMet = Object.values(data.requirements).every(Boolean);
const completionPercentage = Math.round(
  (Object.values(data.requirements).filter(Boolean).length / 
   Object.keys(data.requirements).length) * 100
);
```

## Production Considerations
